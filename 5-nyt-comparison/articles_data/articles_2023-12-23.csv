"Your very specific, highly idiosyncratic best-ofs of the year.","Earlier this month I asked you to send along your highly specific personal best-of list for 2023. I requested lists not limited to the usual categories like “best movie” or “best book” but that included, say, the best walk you took, or the best idea you had, or the best change you made to your routine. As I considered my own year, compiling my favorite cultural artifacts and foods and experiences, anything I found I was enjoying became a candidate for the list. Take George Winston’s 1982 album “December.” I listened to it for the first time in decades on Thursday, in honor of the winter solstice, and, I thought, “Is this the best nostalgic relistening experience I had this year?” Why not? The beauty of the personal best-of list is its categories are endless, its inventory selected by a jury of one.","{'main': 'The Morning Readers’ Favorite Things of 2023', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['internal-storyline-no', 'Television', 'Movies', 'Books and Literature', 'Christmas', 'New Year', 'Holidays and Special Occasions']",2023-12-23T11:46:49+0000,article,Briefing

Steven Spielberg’s “Munich” was considered by many to be a flop in 2005.

As a critic, I’m trained to study and coolly interpret the language of filmmakers. Off the clock, I watch to be diverted or to be dazzled, to be comforted or to escape, to be challenged or to try to better understand the world, filtered through someone else’s art. Sometimes this habit has helped me feel well equipped to deal with what’s going on in the world, sometimes less so.","{'main': 'The Best Movie About Israel and Gaza Now Came Out 18 Years Ago', 'kicker': 'Guest Essay', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Best Movie About Israel Right Now Is 18 Years Old', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Israel-Gaza War (2023- )', 'Israel', 'Gaza Strip', 'Jews and Judaism', 'Palestinians', 'Movies', 'Munich (Movie)', 'Spielberg, Steven']",2023-12-23T12:00:15+0000,article,Opinion
