When we divorced, five years later in 2019, it felt — among other things — like a betrayal of those early vouches of faith.

They established their first, August Gatherings, in Chinatown nearly 10 years ago with a Cantonese menu that had some creative twists. This time, they’re doubling down, adding additional global influences in a more formal setting and calling the food modern Cantonese. Mr. Leung, a native of Guangzhou who came to New York in 1988, pays homage with dishes like salt-baked chicken, several abalone preparations, fried rice with roasted eel, and Hong Kong style noodles with fish maw. But he will also be adding black truffles to his Cantonese shrimp dumplings, tossing octopus with fusilli, and using balsamic vinegar. Equipment like sous vide is also in his arsenal. “I’m preserving the integrity of Cantonese food but adding international ingredients and techniques,” he said. Among the desserts, he has successfully crossed the classic Chinese egg tart with the Portuguese nata, a similar confection that’s popular in Macau, and which he’s been serving at August Gatherings. Michael Goff, the beverage director, has assembled a tight list that starts at $50 but, with an eye on Wall Street, climbs to a $2,000 Burgundy. The restaurant’s fancy street entrance is next to the modest-looking Courtyard by Marriott, which houses the restaurant on its second floor. The large, airy, well-windowed space seating 168 in a main room and smaller private rooms, is fitted with banquettes and tables in quietly elegant tones of beige and salmon, with fake greenery and flowers and real Chinese ceramics.
