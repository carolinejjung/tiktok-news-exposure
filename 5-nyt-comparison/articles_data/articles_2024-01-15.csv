Collectors give the museum 27 box constructions and collages by the homebody artist who rarely left Queens but became a central figure in 20th century art.,"Joseph Cornell, who died in 1972 at the age of 69, belongs to the tradition of the homebody-artist.

His medium was the Box — that is, the Victorian-era shadow box, and he spent his days in his basement workshop, assembling cork balls, paper cutouts of birds and other dime-store material into improbably poetic arrangements that owed something to French Surrealism.","{'main': 'National Gallery of Art Receives Major Gift of Joseph Cornell Boxes', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'National Gallery Receives Major Gift of Joseph Cornell Boxes', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Art', 'National Gallery of Art', 'Cornell, Joseph', 'Collectors and Collections', 'Museums', 'Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden', 'Washington (DC)']",2024-01-15T17:18:46+0000,article,Arts
