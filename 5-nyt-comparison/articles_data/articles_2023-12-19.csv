The area is now done in earth tones with touches of gold and other colors; the open kitchen is no more. The chefs Jeremiah Stone and Fabián von Hauske Valtierra, of Wildair downtown, are the menu consultants. The chef de cuisine is Vincent Edwards. Next month the high-ceilinged dining room a few steps up from the bar will become Brass, an American take on a brasserie, and the Ninepin Café will be installed, for casual all-day dining, near the hotel entrance.","{'main': 'The Tusk Bar Sets Up in the Evelyn Hotel, in NoMad', 'kicker': 'Off The Menu', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Restaurants', 'Bars and Nightclubs', 'New York City']",2023-12-19T21:47:41+0000,article,Food
