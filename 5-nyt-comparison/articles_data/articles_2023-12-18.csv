"Serve drinks with Zodiac sign glassware, pick up a Bûche de Noël and more food news.","A few blocks from where the Cronut was born, a new pastry mash-up by a French chef is making its debut.

In a show of extreme confidence, it’s the only product sold in the bright white shop of the same name he owns with Edward Geyman, his business partner. A native of the Burgundy region in France who studied pastry-making and has been a pastry consultant in many countries around the globe, Mr. Doyen, 38, arrived in the United States a year ago and began working on this project. “I didn’t just want to reproduce French pastry,” he said. The flavor and filling combinations are endless. For now he has eight colorful examples, including peanut butter and jelly, matcha with white chocolate, walnut with dark chocolate, red velvet with dark chocolate and raspberry, and pecan caramel with milk chocolate chips and sea salt. He has a featured flavor of the month, which for now is s’mores with a marshmallow topping that he torches before serving. He said he’s working on a mini size.","{'main': 'You Know the Cronut.

De Boer also hoped to tap into the area’s vibrant local scene of food growers and artisans. And over the past year and a half, she’s done just that, cultivating relationships with an array of craftspeople who now supply Stissing House with products including hand-woven willow breadbaskets, tapered beeswax candles and scented botanical soaps. “These objects have become part of the DNA of what we do,” said de Boer recently, adding that the restaurant’s newsletter has evolved into a sort of monthly ode to the region’s makers.","{'main': 'In an 18th-Century Tavern, a Different Kind of Holiday Market', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Stissing House (Pine Plains, NY, Restaurant)', 'Hudson River Valley (NY)', 'Handicrafts', 'Restaurants', 'Textiles', 'Flowers and Plants', 'Holidays and Special Occasions', 'Design', 'Art', 'PINE PLAINS (NY)']",2023-12-18T22:11:21+0000,article,T Magazine
