The London-based Charlie Constantinou creates shape-shifting garments with zippers and detachable legs.,"Growing up in North London, Charlie Constantinou was a serious piano student who aspired to a career as a composer. But when, as a teenager, he landed a part-time job at a sneaker store, he became enamored with avant-garde streetwear by designers such as Jun Takahashi of Undercover and Nasir Mazhar — the latter of whom, like Constantinou, is a member of the city’s tight-knit Cypriot community. Soon, Constantinou was dreaming up a collection of his own. The creative process, says the Tottenham-based 25-year-old, felt surprisingly familiar: “It’s very much about world building; I get the same feeling from composition.” After studying design at London’s Central Saint Martins, he launched his namesake brand in 2022 when the influential retailers Ssense and H. Lorenzo bought pieces from his master’s degree collection. In the short time since, he’s developed a clearly defined style informed by both ancient history (spiral motifs taken from Cypriot ceramics) and futurism (astronaut-style boots), expressed largely through the use of quilted expandable nylon, a high-tech version of the textile that can stretch and contract to a dramatic degree. He’s drawn to the crinkly look of the fabric, and to the fact that it can accommodate a wide variety of body types: Many of his pieces are one size fits all and, while billed as men’s wear, are meant for people of all genders.","{'main': 'A Designer’s Endlessly Versatile Clothes', 'kicker': 'T Introduces', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'T Introduces', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Fashion and Apparel', 'Jeans (Apparel)', 'Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design', 'Constantinou, Charlie']",2024-02-27T10:00:35+0000,article,T Magazine

The 1940s Florida home harks back to a different time — and a different continent.,"IT CAN BE hard to tell in Miami what’s natural and what isn’t. The sky is often uncannily blue, the vegetation (palms, sea grapes, jacarandas) a startling green. The bright white sand on South Beach is Floridian but trucked in from mines to combat coastal erosion. And the spiny iguanas that look so at home among the tropical shrubs are in fact invasive, descendants of pets imported from South America in the 1960s; sometimes in the winter, they fall frozen from trees, landing on car windshields.

As temperatures and sea levels rise, the glass-fronted towers along the coast seem increasingly ill suited to their surroundings.","{'main': 'A House Where Old Miami Style Meets Old World Eclecticism', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Here and There', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Real Estate and Housing (Residential)', 'Interior Design and Furnishings', 'Miami Beach (Fla)', 'Casiraghi, Fabrizio', 'ARCHITECTURE']",2024-02-27T10:01:09+0000,article,T Magazine
