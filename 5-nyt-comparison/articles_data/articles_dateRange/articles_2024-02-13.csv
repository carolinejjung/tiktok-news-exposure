The president’s frailty threatens his ability to do the most important part of his job: beating Trump.,"Last fall I found myself at a dinner party that included a former Biden administration official and a Democratic donor, and the conversation turned, naturally, to President Biden’s age and his prospects for re-election. The ex-official said that from inside the White House, where people experience the policymaking process firsthand, Biden was overwhelmingly seen as an effective leader who should run again. The donor, on the other hand, saw Biden mostly at the fund-raisers where watching the president’s meandering speeches left him terrified about the upcoming campaign. The gulf in their perceptions, I think, speaks to the fact that Biden’s age has impaired his ability to campaign much more than his ability to govern, which has created an impossible dilemma for the Democratic Party.","{'main': 'Biden’s Age Is a Campaign Problem, Not a Governing One', 'kicker': 'Michelle Goldberg', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['United States Politics and Government', 'Biden, Joseph R III', 'Presidential Election of 2024', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Democratic Party', 'Age, Chronological', 'Hur, Robert Kyoung', 'Classified Information and State Secrets']",2024-02-13T00:00:08+0000,article,Opinion

Federal reparations would help redress both the grievances of American history and the racial inequities that still define the present.,"In my debut novel, a family retraces their lineage in order to be eligible for the nation’s first federal reparations program for Black Americans.

Long before that, Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, had gifted the land to his squire Giacometto di Lucia dell’Atella, whose family held onto it for generations and from whom Casa degli Atellani got its name; Leonardo da Vinci spent time there in the late 1490s while painting “The Last Supper” across the street.","{'main': 'Saying Goodbye to a Legendary Milanese Palazzo', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Walls Had Ears', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Interior Design and Furnishings', 'Castellini Baldissera, Nicolo', 'Milan (Italy)', 'Historic Buildings and Sites', 'ARCHITECTURE']",2024-02-13T10:02:14+0000,article,T Magazine
