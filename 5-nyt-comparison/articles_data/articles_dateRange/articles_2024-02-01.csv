"A young woman booked her first big trip, a Mediterranean cruise on Norwegian, but missed the boat when her flight was delayed. Since she bought the cruise line’s own travel protection plan, why is she stuck with the bill?","After graduating from college in 2022 and working for a year, I used my bonus and some of my savings to book a nine-day Mediterranean cruise on Norwegian Cruise Line for my partner and me. Our $7,657 cruise package included airfare from Atlanta to Barcelona, Spain, via Newark, and Norwegian’s own BookSafe Travel Protection Plan, which included travel insurance and also allowed me to “cancel for any reason” for a 75 percent credit. Weather delayed our first flight, we missed the connection, and United Airlines could not get us to Barcelona in time to embark. I called Norwegian and agents suggested I buy last-minute tickets on a different airline, but I don’t have that kind of money. And even if I did, there were no direct flights to later ports, and I was unwilling to risk missing another connecting flight. So we spent the night in the Newark airport, paid for a return flight to Atlanta the next morning and canceled the cruise and remaining air legs. I got $1,184 back right away from Norwegian, and then an additional $232 back (for my return flight) from travel insurance when I filed a trip delay claim, but a trip cancellation claim for the cruise was denied outright. I feel I should at least get the 75 percent credit — otherwise what was the protection plan for? Can you help? Ivy, Atlanta","{'main': 'Help!

Our TV critic recommends a Nicole Kidman-led family drama in which no one’s quite sure where home really is.,"“Prestige TV” is often synonymous with “show about rich people being sad,” and by that metric, “Expats” (Amazon Prime Video) is easily among the most prestigious shows. Early on, its silky misery feels hollow — trite, even — but over six episodes, that emptiness becomes less of a void and more of a vessel, holding elegant, complicated ideas about class, pain and mothering.","{'main': 'What to Watch This Weekend: Come Home to ‘Expats’', 'kicker': 'The Watching Newsletter', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'A Call to Shelter at Home, Wherever That Is', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Television', 'Kidman, Nicole', 'Hong Kong', 'Expats (TV Program)', 'internal-sub-only-nl']",2024-02-01T20:00:05+0000,article,Arts
What T Magazine editors are coveting for ourselves and eyeing for our loved ones.,"In the winter months, I tend to favor candlelight over electricity in the evenings. If I have to endure the season’s early sunsets and freezing temperatures, at least I can make it cozy (and complexion-flattering) inside. Scented candles can grow cloying after a few hours, so I prefer scented matches — they still lend a sense of occasion to lighting up, but their smell won’t linger long enough to give you a headache. The yuzu incense matches from Hibi are my favorite — the brand was created by Kobe Match Company, which has been producing matches in Japan since 1929. Each one lasts about 10 minutes, and a pad for safe burning is included in the box. I also like Bohème’s Marisol fragrance — its notes of cardamom, clove and sandalwood are infused into extra-long matchsticks. For a touch of old-world charm, Buly is a classic choice: The brand’s perfumed matches come in eight signature scents and are housed in beautifully illustrated boxes. Any of these options would make a charming Valentine’s Day gift paired with a whimsical candle from Wednesday Company. Handmade by the Bronx-based Grace Battista, these playful depictions of croissants, baguettes and fruit look good enough to eat. And they’re unscented, so you can enjoy them long into the night.","{'main': 'T’s Valentine’s Day Gift Guide: Floral Cookware, Scented Matches and More', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Cookware', 'Jewels and Jewelry', 'Tea', ""Valentine's Day"", 'Design', 'Tableware', 'Tomatoes', 'Candles', 'Ceramics and Pottery', 'Gifts']",2024-02-01T20:07:10+0000,article,T Magazine
