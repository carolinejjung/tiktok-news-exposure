"From a reimagined centuries-old palazzo to a private apartment with a rooftop terrace, five new places to stay that offer a fresh vision of the city.","While Rome’s charms may be, as they say, eternal, it’s never been a city particularly prized for its hotels. Until recently, upmarket lodging in the Italian capital usually meant an ostentatiously decorated pile meant to evoke the city’s 16th- and 17th-century palazzi, stuffed with gilded furniture and vague nostalgia. Over the past year or so, an entirely new breed of luxury hotel has emerged, one that pays tribute to the modernist architects who remade much of Rome in the Rationalist style in the early-to-mid-20th century. The Bulgari hotel, for example, opened last summer in a hulking 1930s government building designed by the prominent Trieste-born architect Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo. And the Edition hotel moved into a bank partly attributed to Marcello Piacentini, the architect responsible for the EUR district, the neighborhood of massive edifices constructed under Mussolini. Other notable new offerings take their style cues from 21st-century Scandinavia, deftly blending northern design aesthetics with Italian Renaissance art and Roman artifacts. Here, a closer look at five new accommodations that break with tradition.","{'main': 'Rome Finally Gets the Modern Hotels It Deserves', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'People Places Things', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Rome (Italy)', 'Hotels and Travel Lodgings', 'ARCHITECTURE', 'Historic Buildings and Sites']",2024-02-08T22:13:02+0000,article,T Magazine
