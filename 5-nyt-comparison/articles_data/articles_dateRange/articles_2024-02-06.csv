Just this past year he opened three, and he is about to add another for a total of 12 at various levels of service and price. The newest one, open later this week, is his first that is not rooted in his native Mexico or even Cuba, like his Cuban-style diner, Coppelia. It is Italian. “My cooking background is French, my restaurants are Mexican but there’s a place in my heart for Italian,” he said. “I’m ready to cook my own interpretation.” His ode to Italy, named for the Italian sour cherry, looks to Roman cooking and that of coastal areas. It has moved into the Upper East Side townhouse space occupied until last year by the Simone. But unlike the garden-level predecessor, his restaurant, with 60 seats, will occupy two floors and will add a bar in the almost summery setting with light colors accented with green downstairs. Upstairs, a more opulent room is done in a ruby palette; both areas will offer the same menu. Louis Skibar, a frequent partner, is a co-owner. To begin, the restaurant will serve dinner featuring various supplì, like arancini; baked clams with salsa verde; bucatini carbonara with duck guanciale and duck eggs; pappardelle with Sunday gravy and beef cheeks; and suckling pig agrodolce. Soon, there will be breakfast with panini and classic Italian pastries like sfogliatelle, and lunch.
