The joke format, inspired by a writing quirk of the books, featured a dialogue tag tacked onto a spoken phrase so that the result was a groan-inducing one-liner. “‘Do you feel a draft?’ Tom asked coolly,” a Tom Swifty might go, or “‘You must be my host,’ Tom guessed.”","{'main': 'Modern Swifties Have Transcended the Joke', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Fans (Persons)', 'Social Media', 'Swift, Taylor', 'English Language', 'Pop and Rock Music']",2024-01-01T14:00:03+0000,article,Crosswords & Games
