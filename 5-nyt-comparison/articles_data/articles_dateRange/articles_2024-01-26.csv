The complexities of 21st-century romantic entanglements are front and center in this month’s roundup of hidden gems on your subscription streaming services.,"Vuk Lungulov-Klotz’s micro-budget New York drama is everything indie movies are supposed to be: keenly observed and modestly executed, telling us a story and showing us a world we don’t usually see in mainstream cinema.

Every performer is on point, natural and credible, and the screenplay is lived-in and mostly devoid of histrionics (Feña gives a big speech to his dad about how difficult it all is, and it’s the single false note, the only scene that feels like a scene from a movie instead of a scene from real life). This is a small film, but a mighty one.","{'main': '‘Mutt,’ ‘Unpregnant’ and More Streaming Gems', 'kicker': 'Beyond the Algorithm', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Movies', 'Flux Gourmet (Movie)', 'Greta (Movie)', 'In Fabric (Movie)', 'Mutt (Movie)', 'Sound of the Police (Movie)', 'Unpregnant (Movie)']",2024-01-26T12:00:01+0000,article,Movies
