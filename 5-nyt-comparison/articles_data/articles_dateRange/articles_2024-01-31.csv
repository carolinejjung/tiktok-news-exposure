Many New College athletes had no idea they were part of Ron DeSantis’s attack on “woke ideology.” Then the semester began.,"They came to be somewhere sunny and warm. Some came because their parents lived nearby; others came from far away — from abroad — because it was a way to study in the United States. Madison Garcia, a softball player who previously attended Lincoln University, a historically Black college in Missouri, came because she was lonely and cold in the Midwest. The school recruiting Garcia and the others, New College of Florida, offered all freshmen free laptops, which was a nice perk. But the main reason most of the athletes showed up for the very first season of varsity sports at New College was that someone there was offering them the chance to keep doing what they loved. “I would do anything to be on that field,” said Nahuel Garcia, a freshman soccer player from Miami. “I’ll be water boy.
