The accessory — which doubles as a diamond ring — takes its inspiration from the design of the iconic perfume bottle.,"In 1920, following the successful launch of her couture house in Biarritz, France, and her subsequent move to Paris’s Rue Cambon, where she opened her flagship boutique, Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel decided to create her first fragrance. She commissioned the French Russian perfumer Ernest Beaux to develop “a woman’s perfume, with a woman’s scent” — which, unlike most single-note options of the era, had a bold floral composition. Beaux imported exotic ingredients from around the world, concocting a mix of more than 80 different notes, including jasmine and May rose harvested from Grasse, France; ylang-ylang flowers from Madagascar; Brazilian tonka beans; and sandalwood. Months later, he presented Chanel with an array of aromatic vials, and she chose the one labeled five. When Beaux asked her what she’d call the perfume, she said, “I present my dress collections on May 5, the fifth day of the fifth month of the year, and so we will let it keep the number it has, and this number will bring it good luck.”","{'main': 'How Chanel No. 5 Became a Necklace', 'kicker': 'First of Its Kind, Last of Its Kind', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'First Of Its Kind Last Of Its Kind', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Jewels and Jewelry', 'Perfumes and Fragrances', 'Fashion and Apparel', 'Chanel SA', 'Chanel, Coco']",2024-02-07T10:00:57+0000,article,T Magazine
