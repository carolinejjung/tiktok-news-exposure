The Palestinian cause has revived a partnership forged in the civil rights era — and also created new tensions.,"Eva Borgwardt first embraced the Palestinian cause the summer after she graduated from high school.

At home, Borgwardt had often wondered who she would have been during the civil rights movement. Would she have really stood up for what was right? Now, as the demonstrations for racial justice and against police brutality dominated the news, her mother, a history professor and scholar of human rights law, told her, “This is a ‘Where were you in history?’ moment.”","{'main': 'Black and Jewish Activists Have Allied for Decades.
