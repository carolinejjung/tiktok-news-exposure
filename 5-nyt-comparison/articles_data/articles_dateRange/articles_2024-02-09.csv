"This month’s picks include a decades-spanning Chinese drama, a thriller about a teenage immigrant in Canada, an absurdist French crime comedy and more.","The scenes that open this ravishing drama by Wang Xiaoshuai feel like pieces of a cryptic puzzle, gesturing evocatively at a whole that remains out of view. A pair of boys play beside a lake, a death is seen from a distance, and years later, in some other place, a grieving couple struggle to raise a wayward son. Slowly, these fragments swirl together into a decades-spanning epic about two couples in China, brought together in the 1980s by their factory jobs and then torn apart by a series of losses, including those inflicted by the country’s one-child policy.","{'main': 'Five International Movies to Stream Now', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'International Flavor In a Variety of Genres', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}",['Movies'],2024-02-09T16:44:43+0000,article,Movies
