A city that no longer accommodates wandering no longer accommodates wondering. A flâneur without freedom falls into a zombified routine.,"In his 1863 essay “The Painter of Modern Life,” Charles Baudelaire described the passionate city dweller as “a kaleidoscope gifted with consciousness.” In the French poet’s eyes, the city dweller had a unique opportunity to absorb and mirror the poetry of freely moving multitudes. For the committed flâneur, Baudelaire wrote, “the crowd is his element, as the air is that of birds and water of fishes.”","{'main': 'Baudelaire Would Be Run Over in New York City Today', 'kicker': 'Guest Essay', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Price When Wanderers Cannot Wander', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['New York City', 'Walking', 'Writing and Writers']",2024-01-07T14:00:29+0000,article,Opinion
"A monumental art exhibit at the Met explored the kind of rivalry that can complicate, and fortify, a friendship. I recognized it all too well.","Near the end of the “Manet/Degas” exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, there is a small drawing by Edgar Degas of a bearish man with a beard. At first glance, you might think the man in the drawing is Edouard Manet, but in fact he’s an author and critic named Edmond Duranty. Nine years before this drawing was created, Duranty wrote something critical of Manet, in response to which Manet, encountering Duranty in a cafe, slapped him. Duranty demanded that Manet apologize. Manet refused. Duranty challenged Manet to a duel. The duel, by sword, took place three days later. Manet was unscathed; I guess you could say he won. Duranty, the man in the Degas drawing, “received a wound in his upper chest,” as the museum text accompanying the drawing states matter-of-factly. I stared incredulously at the text’s last line: “Surprisingly, the two men remained friends after the incident.”","{'main': 'Manet and Degas and Robert and Me', 'kicker': 'Guest Essay', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Degas, Edgar', 'Manet, Edouard', 'Friendship', 'Metropolitan Museum of Art', 'Art', 'Bingham, Robert', 'Writing and Writers']",2024-01-07T14:00:29+0000,article,Opinion
Generative A.I. is often described as being in its infancy. The truth is a little more of a handful.,"As the mother of an 8-year-old, and as someone who’s spent the past year experimenting with generative A.I., I’ve thought a lot about the connection between interacting with one and with the other. I’m not alone in this. A paper published in August in the journal Nature Human Behaviour explained how, during its early stages, an artificial intelligence model will try lots of things randomly, narrowing its focus and getting more conservative in its choices as it gets more sophisticated. Kind of like what a child does. “A.I. programs do best if they start out like weird kids,” writes Alison Gopnik, a developmental psychologist.","{'main': 'I Finally Figured Out Who ChatGPT Reminds Me Of', 'kicker': 'Guest Essay', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['ChatGPT', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computers and the Internet', 'Parenting']",2024-01-07T14:00:29+0000,article,Opinion
