One of the few truly independent creative heads of a major brand, he’s built an improbable empire by making clothes as grotesque as they are glamorous.

Now that Owens is back, he and Lamy, a 5-foot-2 agent of creative chaos with kohl-rimmed electric blue eyes, gold-plated teeth and two young grandchildren, have been overseeing their latest project: relocating the Rick Owens men’s and women’s runway shows, normally staged in the monumental courtyard at the Palais de Tokyo, a neo-Classical-style structure housing two museums with stone colonnades and a large reflecting pool, to their living room.","{'main': 'Rick Owens, Fashion’s Patriarch of Freaks', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Patriarch of Freaks', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Fashion and Apparel', 'Content Type: Personal Profile', 'Owens, Rick', 'Lamy, Michele', 'Paris (France)']",2024-02-16T10:01:23+0000,article,T Magazine

But the parasitic worm has been touted as a cure-all by various ancient medicine traditions: It can be seen in Ancient Egyptian tomb paintings and traditional portraits of Dhanvantari, the Hindu deity associated with Ayurveda. And in medieval and early modern Europe, when impure blood was believed to unbalance the humors of the body and cause disease, the creatures were seen as solicitous helpers, ever ready to relieve a patient of their unwelcome plasma. As the British medical historians Robert G.W. Kirk and Neil Pemberton wrote in their 2013 book, “Leech,” the worms were long celebrated as a gentle alternative to the lancet and became known, during the so-called leech mania of the early 19th century, as “the tools of the physician who cared.” In 1828, the French hospital system alone prescribed tens of millions of leeches, for conditions ranging from insomnia to smallpox.","{'main': 'Why Wellness Culture Has Cozied Up to Leeches', 'kicker': 'Notes on the Culture', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Wriggling Wellness Assistants', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Leeches', 'Blood', 'Alternative and Complementary Medicine']",2024-02-16T18:12:56+0000,article,T Magazine
