This month’s picks include a bevy of animated critters and a science-fiction fantasy.,"The comedian Bill Burr as the voice of a jaded animated turtle in a kids’ movie may be enough to pique the curiosity of some parents. In “Leo,” Burr’s Squirtle is the grouchy sidekick to Leo, a septuagenarian lizard (voiced by Adam Sandler). They share a terrarium in a fifth grade classroom in Florida, and when Leo realizes he’s reaching the end of his reptilian life span, he has a sudden urge to escape and see the world. When the humorless substitute teacher Ms. Malkin (Cecily Strong) tells the students that they each have to take one of the two creatures home for the weekend to learn responsibility, Leo sees his chance. He goes home with the chatty Summer (Sunny Sandler), and reveals that he can speak. Once each kid stops freaking out about bringing home a talking lizard, Leo turns into a life coach/therapist for them. Through old-school wisdom, the children learn lessons about kindness, acceptance and confidence. The script — by Sandler, Robert Smigel (“Saturday Night Live,” “Hotel Transylvania”) and Paul Sado (“Sandy Wexler”) — doesn’t break any new ground, but there are enough cute jokes, so-so musical numbers and visual gags to hold the interest of preschool- and elementary-aged kids. Smigel directed the movie with “S.N.L.” alums Robert Marianetti and David Wachtenheim.","{'main': '5 Children’s Movies to Stream Now', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Movies', 'Children and Childhood', 'Leo (Movie)', 'Strange World (Movie)', 'The Amazing Maurice (Movie)', 'The Bad Guys (Movie)']",2024-01-12T12:00:06+0000,article,Movies
