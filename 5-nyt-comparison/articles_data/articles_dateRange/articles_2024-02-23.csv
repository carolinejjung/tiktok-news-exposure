In Lin’s retelling, the workers are resurrected as demons, seething with chaotic desire.","{'main': 'When a Job Becomes a Literal Hell', 'kicker': 'Notes on the Culture', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Labor and Jobs', 'Movies', 'Art', 'Kline, Josh (1979- )', 'Work-Life Balance']",2024-02-23T23:02:22+0000,article,T Magazine
