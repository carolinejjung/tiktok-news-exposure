Why pop culture now flirts with extraterrestrials as much as it fears them.,"Every generation gets the extraterrestrial invasion its times demand. In 1938, conflicts simmering in Europe meant that a radio broadcast of “The War of the Worlds” became a panic-inducing news event in America. In the McCarthy era, manufactured paranoia about Communists led to movies like “Invasion of the Body Snatchers” (1956) and “I Married a Monster From Outer Space” (1958). The terrors of the Cold War coincided with the skittering xenomorph of “Alien” (1979), a conscienceless creature willing to destroy humanity to ensure its own survival.","{'main': 'Aliens Have Never Been More Alluring', 'kicker': 'Notes on the Culture', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': '', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Culture (Arts)', 'Extraterrestrial Life', 'Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO)', 'Movies', 'Art']",2024-01-09T16:40:24+0000,article,T Magazine
"The Korean Chinese restaurant Octo opens in Koreatown, Bibliotheque brings a book-lined wine den to Mercer Street and more restaurant news.","Beef or chicken? The restaurateur Simon Kim now has you covered either way. An owner of the Korean steakhouse Cote is opening what he calls a “fried chicken cathedral,” with a dining room framed by glowing, barrel-vaulted arches that disappear to infinity, thanks to a rear wall mirror. The design is by the Rockwell Group, involving David Rockwell’s personal touch. But the food is Mr. Kim’s idea, more than four years in the making, with the executive chef Seung Kyu Kim in charge (no relation to the owner, though the two met while working at Jean-Georges). Simon Kim’s notion is to offer a mix of American and Korean approaches to fried chicken and give it glamour with (supposedly) more sustainable ingredients in a more elegant setting. At Coqodaq it’s one-size-fits-all, a $38 dinner that includes chicken soup; a bucket of chicken parts fried in a gluten-free batter based on rice flour, chicken glazed with gochujang or soy and garlic; a cold perilla noodle dish; banchan, small dishes, that include palate-cleansing white radish; and soft serve frozen yogurt. Starters (extra) include some seafood options. The chickens are pasture-raised in Pennsylvania Amish country, and triple-fried in oil produced in Iowa from fermented Brazilian sugar cane. The name of the restaurant blends French, American and Korean words for chicken. The sommelier, Victoria James, who also curates the wines at Cote, has a wine list that features Champagne, which she and Mr. Kim agree is the ideal beverage for fried chicken. Her list offers 400 of them, and other sparklers by the glass and the bottle. Considering that fried chicken is finger-food, in the front of the restaurant, there’s a hand-washing area with three sinks. Some high-top tables near the entrance are for walk-ins, there’s a long bar, and garage doors will open to an outside patio in warmer weather. Tables at the leather-upholstered booths beneath the arches in the 190-seat room have lazy susans, the better for sharing.
