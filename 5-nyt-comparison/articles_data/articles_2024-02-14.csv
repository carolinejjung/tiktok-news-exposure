He died in 1981 at the age of 36 before he had to witness his legacy undergo a tough cross-examination. Did Marley’s generosity to strangers balance out his dismissal of women?

Their films have gone viral for their awful production values. But their success says fascinating things about what comes after prestige TV.,"There’s a 2008 movie that offers an odd preview of today’s entertainment. In Michel Gondry’s “Be Kind Rewind,” a bizarre accident demagnetizes the entire inventory of a video rental store, so a clerk and his eccentric friend decide to remake all the films themselves, from “The Lion King” to “Driving Miss Daisy” to “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Their versions are 20 minutes long (at most), shot on an old hand-held video camera and produced in a delightfully quirky, ad hoc way: handcrafted props and sets, buddies working as extras, costumes from the local dry cleaner. They call their tapes “Sweded,” explaining the time it takes to supply films by claiming the copies have to be imported from Scandinavia. In Gondry’s fantasy, the community responds well to this homespun cinema: Not only does demand go up, but store patrons begin to participate in making the movies. Gondry’s theory, he has said, was that “people would enjoy films better if they shot them themselves.”","{'main': 'Tubi Is Reviving a Lost Joy: Watching Really, Really Bad Movies', 'kicker': 'Screenland', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Post Taste', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Video Recordings, Downloads and Streaming', 'Social Media', 'Tubi Inc', 'Movies']",2024-02-14T10:02:32+0000,article,Magazine
