A critic whose love of the operas of Giuseppe Verdi goes back nearly 60 years traveled to northern Italy to visit the places that shaped the man and his music.,"I was 15 when I went to my first Verdi opera, “Il Trovatore,” at the Met, the old Met, in 1964. I could barely figure out what was going on but didn’t care. Leontyne Price sang Leonora, and I was in awe of her plush, beautiful voice. The singing, the chorus, the orchestra, the emotional drama, the music with its mixture of soaring melody, intensity and structure (though I couldn’t have expressed this back then) all hooked me. Two months later I was back at the Met for Verdi’s “Otello” starring, no less, Renata Tebaldi as Desdemona. I still remember the poignant warmth and uncanny bloom of her voice as she sang the sighing refrain of “salce, salce” in the “Willow Song.”","{'main': 'A Pilgrimage to Verdi-land', 'kicker': 'listening tour', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Soil From Which Verdi’s Operas Burst Forth', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Opera', 'Travel and Vacations', 'Content Type: Personal Profile', 'Culture (Arts)', 'Casa Verdi (Milan, Italy)', 'La Scala Opera House (Milan, Italy)', 'Teatro Regio (Parma, Italy)', 'Verdi, Giuseppe', 'Italy', 'Parma (Italy)', 'Milan (Italy)', 'Falstaff (Opera)']",2023-12-29T10:01:25+0000,article,Arts
