This new numbered-edition Omega Speedmaster sounds as good as it looks.,"Time ticks by silently but, in the arcane universe of mechanical watches, sound is the ultimate achievement. While chiming clocks were pioneered in the 1600s, it wasn’t until the late 19th century that the apparatus was perfected in miniature. Squeezing in the more than 100 additional components necessary to have a modern-style wristwatch strike with pinpoint accuracy and rich, clear peals — each watch sounds subtly different — is considered the height of horological craft, and most companies abandoned such complex models long ago. But a few holdouts continue to make such timepieces. Among them is Omega, whose new numbered-edition Speedmaster marries the Swiss brand’s stopwatch chronograph feature with a minute repeater, enabling wearers to press a button that triggers a series of tones to signal the minutes, tens of seconds and seconds. The unique combination, housed in an 18-karat gold case with an aventurine dial and rose guilloche subdials, is arrestingly beautiful while ringing every bell.

Veterans returning from abroad found a new diversity of college art programs and art schools thanks to the abundance of federal education grants made available by the G.I. Bill. The expansion of government-subsidized housing loans meant that cheap space was also easy to come by, as New York had a then-ample stock of residential and industrial buildings. In the following decades, which saw the birth of Abstract Expressionism, followed by Pop Art, followed by minimalism — all locally grown movements — the city also became the capital of what we now call the art world, a multibillion-dollar, mostly unregulated global economy of galleries, auction houses and fairs that has grown without interruption through wars, recessions and two pandemics.","{'main': 'Against All Odds, New York’s Artist Buildings Have Survived', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Artist Is Present', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Art', 'Photography', 'Real Estate and Housing (Residential)', 'Income Inequality', 'Brooklyn Army Terminal (Brooklyn, NY)', 'Rossin, Rachel (1987- )', 'Brooklyn (NYC)', 'New York City']",2024-02-26T10:03:03+0000,article,T Magazine
