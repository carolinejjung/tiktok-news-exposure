For his spring 1999 collection, he reinterpreted the look of Ali MacGraw’s character, the pool-lounging daughter of wealthy parents, in the 1969 film “Goodbye, Columbus,” inaugurating hooded anorak dresses and introducing playful giraffe spots, a new iteration of his signature animal prints. “I’m always searching for the perfect balance of timelessness and excitement,” the designer says.","{'main': 'A Bag That Melds the ’60s, the ’90s and Today', 'kicker': 'First of Its Kind, Last of Its Kind', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'First Of Its Kind Last Of Its Kind', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Kors, Michael', 'Fashion and Apparel', 'Dresses', 'Bardot, Brigitte']",2024-02-28T10:01:00+0000,article,T Magazine

Plus: a new dining destination with rooms for the night in the Swedish countryside and more from T’s cultural compendium.,"Grapes have been associated with pleasure since ancient times, a symbol of Bacchus, the god of wine and revelry. These days, clusters of plummy Concords, oval autumn royals and dusky kyohos are decorating dinner tables, doubling as cornucopian decorations and low-effort snacks. “You can get a beautiful, imperfect drip and drape from grapes,” says the interior stylist Colin King, 35, who overflowed a marble urn with abundant mounds of them for the launch of his furniture collection, a collaboration with the Future Perfect, in New York this past fall. Although he uses green grapes for daytime parties, for evening events he prefers the “moody, sensual vibe” of dark varieties — like the attenuated, oblong moon drops that the artist Laila Gohar, 35, mixed with red globes and flames to form an edible monolith for the recent opening of the Essentiel Antwerp clothing store in New York. The chef Mina Stone, 42 — who runs Mina’s, the cafe at MoMA PS1 in Queens, and is a go-to caterer for art gallery dinners — favors Thomcords, a sweet, seedless hybrid she often serves with dessert to “provide heft and a colorful backdrop” for daintier confections. She also likes to roast grapes alongside seared duck breast. In London, the pastry chef Claire Ptak, the owner of Violet bakery, offers what she calls fragolina cupcakes, named for the fragola (Italian for “strawberry”) grapes that she cooks down, then purées and adds to the buttercream frosting. The fragolas “taste like a berryish Concord,” says Ptak, 49, who tops each cake with a small cluster of fruit. The frosted treats “transport you back to childhood when you take the first bite,” she says, “and then you realize they’re also very grown-up.” — Lauren Joseph","{'main': 'Why Are Grapes Suddenly Everywhere?', 'kicker': 'People, Places, Things', 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'Stay Swede', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","['Sweden', 'Ptak, Claire', 'Gohar, Laila', 'Jewels and Jewelry', 'Grapes', 'Hotels and Travel Lodgings', 'Restaurants']",2024-02-28T10:01:51+0000,article,T Magazine

"Three months after an attack, its victims grapple with what it means to be Palestinian in America.","Kinnan Abdalhamid lived in the United States until he was 2, when his mother, Tamara Tamimi, made her big move to the West Bank. That was where her parents were born, and for her, the idea of a Palestinian home had become a lodestar.

The news segment portrayed Tamara as being “caught between two worlds” — an American one, in which she rehearsed “Bye Bye Birdie” at school, and a Palestinian one, in which she spoke Arabic and struggled to reach relatives back home. She finally moved to the West Bank in 2005, as the region teetered on a precarious peace.
