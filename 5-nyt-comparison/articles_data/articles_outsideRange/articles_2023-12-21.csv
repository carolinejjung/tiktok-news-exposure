"Louise Glück’s mode of lamentation was her signature, and it seems fitting that one of her poems occasions the end of this column, after nine years.","In “Primavera,” Louise Glück’s fascination with both pastoral scenes and the devastation of loss coalesces in a vision of springtime somewhere, perhaps in a field, where “someone has drawn a picture of the sun.” No one has signed the image; the gesture is anonymous, just as the poet imagines every effort will be at the end of the world. Still, “the artist intends a mood of celebration.” Glück’s mode of lamentation was her signature, and it seems fitting that one of her poems occasions the end of this column, after nine years.

Zack Snyder creates a space opera that’s bloated but rarely buoyant.,"Oddly, for a movie that’s rated PG-13 and often plays like a young-adult fantasy, Zack Snyder’s “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire” features at least two attempted sexual assaults and a queasily erotic encounter between a shirtless man and a many-tentacled alien. The film’s most thorough violation, though, is of its cinematic bloodline: To call “Rebel Moon” a “Star Wars” pastiche — with a dash of “Dune,” a lick of “Lord of the Rings” and a whole heap of “Seven Samurai”— is both glaringly accurate and somewhat redundant.

It’s a loose reworking of “Much Ado About Nothing,” and, presumably, the first Shakespeare adaptation where a dog does yoga — and certainly the first in which a man (GaTa) serenades a koala. Nevertheless, the film, directed by Will Gluck, who wrote the screenplay with Ilana Wolpert, is so awkwardly assembled that our attention gets pulled away from the leads to the bizarrely lavish buffet spreads in the background.
