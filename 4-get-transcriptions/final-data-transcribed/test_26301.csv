Not gonna happen. It's just hard because people know that if I was president, I would make the big railroad happen because I'd lay the tracks down myself because that's the kind of girl and leader and she president I'd be. And I don't know how people found the paper I wrote in high school that perfectly explains how to solve the economy, but whoever found that, please put that back where you found it because I've changed my priorities in life and I don't wanna be president. I really wanna pursue long form improv and if people know that I know how to solve the economy, they're gonna make me do it. But I don't wanna spend all my time with fucking losers. Sorry, sorry. Cat's out of the bag. If you are the president, you gotta hang out with losers a lot of the time. I don't wanna hang out with losers. I wanna hang out with cool friends like my friend Ash. I'm supposed to learn how to skateboard soon. Also, I'm literally not even old enough to run because I'm the youngest girl alive and I know that eats you haters up and I know you wake up crying in your sleep because you're like, God, she has everything."

Due to a recent study, eating instant noodles two to three times a week has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Due to some other studies, climate change is throwing the entire water cycle into chaos across the U.S. They're saying that as the planet continues to warm, the cycle is expected to be increasingly stretched, warped, and broken. Obviously everybody knows what a water cycle is, it's condensation, precipitation, evaporation. If you haven't heard the news yet, Delta is adding another eclipse flight as companies look to capitalize on the solar event. Basically, there's a solar eclipse that's happening in a couple of weeks across the U.S. and Delta is going to let people fly to view it in the air. Private Lunar Lander sends back first pics from its moon landing, if you didn't hear about that. This is the picture. Do you believe the moon landing is real? This woman was just charged $1,010 for a single Subway sandwich and is yet to be given a solution. Basically, after she left the Subway, she looked at the receipt and noticed it was $1,000. She didn't notice that in there. Subway has not given this woman her money back. They didn't do anything at the store whenever she went back and there's no phone number for her to call, so Subway fixed this. This Dutch supermarket just introduced a slow checkout for lonely elderly people who want someone to talk to. I do these roundups every day, so add me and come back to me tomorrow."
