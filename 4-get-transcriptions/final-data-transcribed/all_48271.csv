They're facing disciplinary action accused of taking photos of some of their female classmates unknowingly. Now, according to the union leader, the school's principal notified parents Thursday saying some ninth and 10th grade students secretly have been taking inappropriate pictures of juniors and seniors and then shared them with other students. Not only that, the principal says the students turned them into trading cards and graded their photos. Now, we've reached out to the school for comment. Disciplinary action, they say, is still being discussed."

I just want to make sure there's no one else in there to start, and then I'll talk to you when I'm done. There's no one in there right now. OK. Come out here and talk to me then. Yeah. I'm going to be honest with you. We got a report that you were seen walking into your dorm with alcohol. OK. Is there alcohol in there? I don't answer questions. What's your name and your badge number? NMSU Police. Title and name? I'm the security officer. Oh, security officer, OK. You have an ID with you? I do. OK, can I see it? You suspect me of a crime? I do. OK, what crime, and how can you articulate it? Minor possession of alcohol. We got a report that you were walked in. So it's like here that they say, they said thing? OK. It's a, yeah, right? It's like they said that he has. And that's how you're going to articulate it? So we don't have to go down this route. If you want to go down this route, we can. Well, I really don't. But like, I'm studying right now. I'm doing homework. Can knock on my door. I'm out here. I want to know what's on. You say that they said that there's alcohol in this room, or that they saw me going into this room, and that there's alcohol in there. How can you articulate it, though? OK, so that's why I'm here talking to you. Yeah. OK, so I still need an ID, you? No. And then we need to go from there. You have to suspect me of a crime. I do. You realize that cops in New Mexico don't have qualified immunity, right? OK, so folks, from here on, let's just be careful with what you are about to do right now. You're saying that you want my ID, but right now, you or yourself can't articulate a crime that I've committed. So I already explained to you why I'm here. I know what you hear. But OK, is my ID going to tell you if there's alcohol in that room? No. But I still need to identify you. My name is Joel. Joel what? Joel. I need your first, last name, and your date of birth. No, you don't. I do. If you don't want to provide that to me, though. You don't want to call Officer Donovan, or one of your supervisors here? Yeah, I can get a surgeon over here. All right, then you're calling him, because right now, this is not what you want to do right now. Because this is a violation of my Fourth Amendment. OK. All right, let me get a surgeon over here, OK? Yeah. Yeah, that's my roommate. OK, you want to just hang out out here, then? Is he detained? No, that's fine. I just don't want anyone else going in my room. You can go in, then. If he's not detained, he's free to go. Yeah, he's free to go, but he can't go in the room. He can't? No, not at this time. All right. So it's an investigation. I'm talking to him. He doesn't want to identify himself. Until we get this figured out, there's a sergeant on the way that's going to talk to him. Until this gets figured out, I don't want anyone to go in the room. You're free to go anywhere else. That's fine. You're not detained or anything, but that's what's going to happen. Is anything going to happen if I don't identify myself? You can be arrested for concealing identity, yes. So, OK, so that's what I want you to say. If you don't ID to me right now, if I don't give you my ID, then you're going to arrest me. I want you to give me that ultimatum. So just hold on. You want to wait? You said you wanted to wait to speak to a supervisor, so let's just do that. OK, then. OK, thank you. And keep your hands out of your pockets for me. Hi. Hi. Name and badge number, please. Sergeant John Lovelace. My badge number is 212. 212, all right, thank you. Officer said here that if I don't ID."

Coley's defense attorneys argued self-defense, and since this happened, the social media world has really gotten behind Coley, saying Cook was harassing him, a complete stranger. Now, you heard Coley tell Cook to stop a few times, but then pulled that gun and shot one round, injuring the YouTuber. Coley was found not guilty of aggravated malicious wounding and guilty of shooting into an occupied dwelling because this happened inside the mall. Coley faces two to ten years in prison when he's sentenced. Cook, for his part, says he plans to continue making his YouTube prank videos. Now, prosecutors told the jury that Coley brought a gun to a cell phone fight. A lot of people have weighed in on how annoying that type of behavior was, but the jury seemed to side with Coley's argument about self-defense here, which is normally reserved for someone who feels that they or a loved one is in very serious physical danger. So that decision by the jury yesterday certainly raised a lot of eyebrows, but then you see that video, and it raises a whole new set of questions."
