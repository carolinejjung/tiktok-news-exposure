We may have just made a major breakthrough in the Starbucks boycott, but it's probably not the one you were expecting. After over two and a half years of non-stop union busting at their 400 unionized stores across the country, Starbucks has finally agreed to come to the negotiating table with Starbucks Workers United, which means unionized Starbucks workers will finally negotiate the first ever Starbucks union contract. And the fact that Starbucks caved right now probably has something to do with the consumer boycott. From November to December of 2023, Starbucks suffered the longest dip in its stock price since it first went public. And in the Middle East where the boycott has been even more intense and targeted, they have shuttered a lot of their stores. Starbucks executives said that the boycotts happening in the United States are driven by misconceptions about our position. I do think that since the boycott first started, it's kind of snowballed into Starbucks supports Israel so don't support Starbucks, but no one's really clear on how Starbucks supports Israel. This really all started after Starbucks Workers United posted a statement in solidarity with Palestine on Twitter on October 9th. Because Starbucks corporate didn't want the union statement in support of Palestine to be confused with the official Starbucks corporate response, they sued the union for copyright infringement of their logo, which is a really common union busting tactic that corporations will use to drown their labor unions in paperwork and legal fees. Starbucks Workers United responded with a counter lawsuit and a statement saying Starbucks saw an opportunity to capitalize on the horrific and tragic events in the Middle East to further its unprecedented illegal union busting campaign, trying to bully workers into abandoning their union name and logo. Starbucks actually isn't on the official BDS list of targeted boycotts against companies that directly fund the state of Israel, particularly those that profit off of illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Even though the BDS list and Starbucks Workers United didn't call for a consumer boycott, it did kind of work in terms of supporting the union, which is why it started in the first place. I think it feels good and is good for people to feel like they're participating in ending the genocide in Gaza. For most people it feels like an easy yet meaningful thing to do. It's also helped raise awareness against the violence against Palestinians in general. I'm really curious what you guys think. What should the next steps be for the Starbucks boycott? Should we keep doing it? Should we change strategies? Is it working? Is it not? And maybe find some answers to the question."
