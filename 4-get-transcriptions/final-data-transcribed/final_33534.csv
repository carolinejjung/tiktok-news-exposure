5,7325130140306967854,"You guys know how American presidents handled American citizens' overwhelming disapproval of the Vietnam War. In the past 100 days, hundreds of thousands of Americans have voiced their disapproval of American involvement in the bombardment of Russia. But despite 61% of likely voters supporting the U.S. calling for a permanent ceasefire, Joe Biden surpassed Congress and sent millions in aid to Israel to continue bombing of Russia. This is not the first time that an American president continued U.S. involvement in a devastating war despite American disapproval. The Vietnam War was notoriously opposed by the American people, and presidents like Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon received a lot of backlash for dragging that bloody war out. The war lasted for almost 20 years and resulted in the death of 58,220 members of the U.S. military, as well as the slaughter of 2 million civilians in Vietnam and its surrounding countries. Between 1963 to 1975, it's reported that tens of millions of Americans protested against the Vietnam War by participating in marches, hunger strikes, work strikes, and refusal to partake in the military drafts. But still, the war carried on despite growing disdain from the American public. John F. Kennedy hinted that he would withdraw from the war if re-elected, but he was assassinated before that could ever happen. Lyndon B. Johnson was heavily associated with the controversial war and didn't even run for re-election. Protesters would actually show up wherever he was, which resulted in violence from police who would beat them with their nightsticks, and so Johnson would rarely make public appearances in America. When running for president, Nixon made promises that he would end the war, but instead actually sabotaged peace deals, and later withdrew troops from Vietnam, but then sent more troops into the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos, devastating those countries with the help of his advisor Henry Kissinger. In attempts to end the war with some dignity after serious condemnation from the American public, he called on the silent majority to show support for the war, and even orchestrated violent pro-war demonstrations, often referred to as hard hat riots, because they were led by construction workers who would assault anti-war protesters with little to no intervention from the police. American forces themselves were complicit in violence towards anti-war protesters, like when the Ohio National Guard shot 12 American students who were unarmed at Kent State University, also known as the Kent State Massacre. Now, despite the chaos and growing divide between the Americans that the Vietnam War caused, Nixon kept at it until there was finally a truce, and Nixon eventually became the first and only president to resign, following another scandal he could not get out of, and thousands of American families, and now veterans, still feel the effects of the losses caused by the presidents who did not care for what the American people wanted. If you don't believe me, you can read about it, and as always, I've left all sources in the comments."

Just walking along the street, you know, this man comes down the porch, approaches us, pulls out a pistol, like, I just remember gunshots and falling down. Did you know you were shot? I didn't quite process the fact until I, like, looked at my phone and I saw my phone had blood on it. I was like, oh, I've been shot. Was your mind sort of, like, comprehending this is happening in Burlington, Vermont, to me?

Which, by the way, America is the daughter of Honduran immigrants, and her mom used to work as a cleaning lady in hotels. But now that she has her first Oscar nomination, most of the conversation is focused on her white co-workers. White feminism is also acting like this is the biggest crisis women have ever faced, when right now, women and little girls in Gaza are being unalived, starved, tortured, not having access to period products, being forced to give birth without anesthesia. But I'm supposed to be mad that your white icons didn't get the nominations that you wanted them to get? Women of color have been snubbed since the beginning of time, and they keep getting snubbed, and it's not surprising that the Oscars, a historically racist and sexist academy, is doing this. But what is annoying is the fact that white feminists continue to show their hypocrisy, walking all over women of color in the process. This is the year that we've had the first Native American woman to be ever nominated for Best Actress. Are the white feminists celebrating this? No. They're throwing shade at her in the LA Times.

31,7332275239281331502,"I've had about a hundred family members at this point who have been killed, including physicians, pharmacists, lawyers, engineers, dozens and dozens of children, multiple small babies. I can't tell all their stories, but I just want to tell a few. October 25, 10 members of my family, all three generations of one side of my family, were all killed. His son, who was a physician, Dr. Tawfiq Al-Farra, his wife, who was pregnant, two of their beautiful daughters Reem and Hala, Jamad's brother, Assam, his wife, Samad, their daughters, Rusul, Tuqa, and Nadyan. Multiple generations all killed in one Israeli missile strike. Tuqa, one of the younger women in the family, her wedding day was the day she was killed. The three brothers built their home themselves, the same home that the Israeli strikes destroyed. Another day, a couple days later, my cousins Hatim and Aziz Al-Farra from Khan Yunis, who lived literally 20 yards from where I grew up, were killed, along with 14 other members of their family, seven of their children. Aziz was actually a pharmacist, and Hatim was just an incredible community figure who always had a smile on his face, always was available to help anybody who needed it. The day before he was killed, Hatim had just gone up to my uncle and asked if he could house five families who were made homeless by the Israeli missile strikes in our grandparents' house. One child, one child out of that whole three generations survived. He had an amputation, was in the hospital. He woke up to find out his siblings, his parents, his uncles, and his aunts, his grandparents, all had died—excuse me—and then he died himself in the next day from the trauma injuries from the Israeli attacks, because there wasn't adequate medical care to keep him alive. A couple days after that, November 2nd, my cousins Hani, Huda, and Wafat had died. All siblings were killed in Gaza City, along with my cousin Hani's Croatian wife and my aunt. Huda and Wafat were teachers. Hani was an interior decorator. My cousin Hani initially survived with a fairly minor leg injury, but then he bled to death the next day because he had no access to any functional medical facilities, since they had all been bombed and destroyed by the Israeli attacks. Hani's brother Wael survived and then had to witness the horror of seeing his mother buried from the waist up in the rubble, dead. And he saw his sister Wafat shredded into pieces. All this, you know, they were messaging me and telling me. My other cousin, Natan, who I grew up with and played with as a kid, literally had to bury all his family members in a makeshift grave, because he couldn't even access a cemetery. And he's been going 24 hours at a time with no food or water. Even those in my family who actually fled what was thought to be dangerous areas to safe areas have been targeted. One of my cousins, Samar Alfarra, died in a refugee camp in Rafah around the time she had completed her doctorate for her PhD. And we were about to congratulate her on that doctorate when she was killed. There are family members who've died from a lack of medical care and inability to access medical care. One of my cousins, Abdul Rahim Alfarra, died because he was unable to reach a functional hospital after he was injured. Four of my family members got killed in an Israeli bombing of their car while they were, ironically, trying to go to the Gaza European Hospital for shelter. And then a few weeks ago, Sabar Alfarra, one of my cousins, died with seven of his sons. And then, most recently, just a few days ago, a baby in our family, Sabar Alfarra, who's 20 days old, froze to death, died from hypothermia in a refugee camp. As the dead rose to 100 in my family, to 15,000 children all across Gaza, to 30,000 civilians, as I saw the famine happen, I just kept looking for evidence that our government actually cares about the lives of my family. And I saw none. I kept waiting for a ceasefire that Secretary Blinken had access—had the ability to do, and he refused to do it. I kept waiting for a United Nations resolution to call for a ceasefire, which the United States continued to veto. I kept waiting for something, and all I saw was the opposite. I saw—I saw our U.S. military reserve being used to replenish the Israeli ammunitions for this genocide. I saw, cruelly, just a few days ago, the withdrawal of funding for the United Nations that was supplying over 2 million people that are going through famine. I wrote this letter to Secretary Blinken because I wanted him to see me and see Palestinians as human beings, to put himself in my shoes and ask himself if he saw his family getting killed day after day, month after month, and he knew that somebody in that government could have done something to prevent those 100 people from dying, the suffering of the remaining hundreds of people. How could you sit in a room, given three minutes to face that person and face them, knowing that that person has been directly responsible for the death of your family and all the suffering that your family has seen?"
32,7325526188167040302,"Sheryl Sandberg was once considered one of the most powerful women in business, but the legacy she leaves behind is far from uncomplicated. In case you missed it, Sandberg announced yesterday that she's stepping down from the meta board, making it her final exit from the tech giant where she was COO for more than a dozen years. So one of the big questions I have in the wake of her departure is why the path for high-achieving women, especially in the tech world, so often requires that they play the role of adult. It's a label that implies a certain kind of executive, one who ensures everyone's well-behaved and on schedule, who brings stability and credibility, but not necessarily big vision. So for a generation of women, that may have been the only way in the door, but it's time to examine just how limiting that label can be in perpetuating a false image of women as incomplete leaders and shouldering them with the kind of office housework that's not career-advancing. So it comes down to this. If the default for men in tech is boy genius, for senior women, particularly at the highest level, it's still way too often office mom. So one reason this trope of adult supervision became rampant in Silicon Valley was the rise of the startup founder as Godmind said in the 2000s. The idea was perpetuated by Andreessen Horowitz, whose VC firm grew its reputation in business on the belief that founders must remain CEO to uphold a company's mission. But that often meant bringing in a seasoned executive who could fill in all the gaps where the inexperienced founder was lacking. In other words, Sheryl Sandberg. So this model became so dominant that women in tech were often told to go be a Sheryl to someone's mark, effectively to be the CEO without the title, the economics, or the moral authority. Subsequently, COO became one of the few high-level senior roles women in tech could land, but that rarely led to the CEO job. Not even Sandberg, whose name at one time was tossed around as a possible contender to lead the likes of Disney or even as a presidential candidate. No one seems to talk about those options for her anymore. It's still possible she'll pop up as CEO of a Fortune 500 company, but it's just as likely she's been too tainted by the meta scandals that yes, in many cases she helped create, but was primarily responsible for cleaning up."

Now I personally hate that they don't wait until the game to show these anymore, but this is well worth the watch. Check it out. On Paramount Mountain, the stakes get higher. I mean, I can't get that thing up there. If there were a football, I'd be able to reach the top. What about a football-shaped head? We throw the child. Gutsy call, sir. Smart thinking. What? No, that's dumb thinking. He's not throwing Arnold. Throw him. Throw him. Throw him. Hey, do you want an immunity? I will throw him. What? You can't throw a child at a wall. Madam Orr, shut your face! Shut up. Unless you prefer to freeze to death. I'm not gonna throw a kid. Not built for the moment, I see. I'll throw him. And Creed's here. Watch and learn. Dang, he's good. It's the fifth quarter, and we need a hole-in-one before the seventh-inning stretch. Be brave. Hike! Can you take me higher? I just threw him higher To a place where we won't freeze He just threw me higher I'm good. So close. How are we gonna get up there? Now if there were only someone made of pigskin. Bingo. Oh, dear. Good call by Tua not making that throw, because it would have been the same result, and he gets enough jokes made about him not being able to make throws."

The man they call the young bull makes these boys look like matadors on defense. When his opponents are on the floor, Colin only sees red. His jumper, however, is nothing but green. If you were watching him for the first time, you'd confuse him for a furry, because this man hoops like he's got a tail growing out his shorts. Here's Kevin Durant with the ball. Oh no, it can't be. What, honey? The clock, it just struck yet! Hey, I'm just going to pull from back here, so I don't have to smell your nasty breath. This guy electrifies the crowd with his energy every night. Some players got ice water in their veins, but Colin's got Red Bull. You can tell he never holds a grudge, because he's out here giving his team second chances. Colin almost led a three-on-five comeback at Alabama. You think he can't handle going one-on-one? Get a hand up, son!"

Okay, so it's not necessarily a new phenomenon, but I have seen this so much more in the past couple months, couple weeks. It's happening both in Democratic and Republican events, but there is so much dangerous group thing happening for these folks who are supporting completely unqualified candidates. And I just want people to realize how dangerous it is. We have folks who are constituents who are truly concerned about real issues happening in their communities, or folks who are truly concerned about their tax dollars being spent towards you know what in Pally. And when we have real constituents getting silenced by these mob mentalities, we need to understand how far, how far away we are, what true democracy and what elected leaders are supposed to be doing for their constituents in this country. We're so far away."

So I come up here to the Department of Motor Vehicles and I'm gonna yell at these people about getting my buggy legal because apparently that's what everybody says I can do. Just go up there and get it legal. Let's go see what these people got to say. So I do got a question for you. I bought a 2020 Polaris Ranger. Is there any way I can title that as like a slow-moving vehicle or anything like that? Um, if you do a body change, I guess. You put a tractor triangle on the back of it? Like you see a tractor driving down the road? That is not a tractor. I mean, it's not a tractor, but if I... My first response would be no. So I called FHP, the DOT, and then I drove up to the fuckin' DMV and they all told me the same shit. We don't know. We don't know. You can't make it legal. It's not made for the highway. So, I have my own brilliant fuckin' idea. I just went up to the old tractor supply and bought myself an orange triangle. This identifies as a farm vehicle now. This is a Polaris tractor. That's all it is. That's all it is, officer. You're probably watching this right now. It's a tractor. Y'all let me know if I'm gonna go to jail for this one or not."
